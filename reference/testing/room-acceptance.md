# Room correctness and convergence acceptance

[Testing reference](README.md) · [Expected room features](../rooms/catalog.md)

Run every advertised room sequentially within each lab; independent RDK and
prpl runs may overlap across hosts. This is bounded feature testing, not a soak
or intrinsic stack-speed ranking. A targeted `--world` run is not full coverage.

## Preparation

1. Reserve the lab. Save initial room/service configuration, native/container/
   medium identities and source revisions. No other operator lease or RF writer
   may be active. Do not alter native policy, metrics intervals or VM resources.
2. Copy the **deployed guest's** `wmediumd/configurator/worlds/golden/*.world.json`
   to the observer evidence directory. Match hashes to the loaded world.
3. Copy `tests/room-feature-guest-audit.py` and
   `tests/room-feature-rf-audit.py` into the guest's `/tmp/`, keeping names.
4. Use an installed Playwright/Chromium and preferably a separate observer.
   If colocated, restrict only owned browser GPU threads with `--observer-cpus`,
   using valid CPU IDs. Record host CPU/pressure/temperature/throttle counters
   with `tests/room-feature-host-monitor.py` before, during and after.
5. The room's default 100-action cap is session-wide. A complete catalog may
   exceed it. Save the unit and, if needed, create a **named temporary runtime**
   drop-in under `/run/systemd/system/` that copies the original `ExecStart`
   with only `--max-actions 2000` changed. Clear the old ExecStart in the
   drop-in, daemon-reload and restart **only the room**, outside measurement.
   Verify twenty-client readiness and the chosen cap. Remove only this drop-in
   and restore the original configuration after testing.

Do not discard an RF journal or restart native services to make a case pass.
Keep failures and incomplete runs in separate evidence directories.

## Gates

| Phase | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| Load | Browser selection auto-applies correct world/epoch, resets overrides and commits verified RF |
| Initial settling | Within 90 s after readiness: exact roster, no duplicate MACs, six mesh roles, matching physical/native/rendered ownership |
| Freshness | Current-epoch complete candidate coverage; evaluation and serving metrics at most 30 s old |
| Strict best AP | No stronger eligible same-band AP; distinguish this from policy-margin convergence |
| Stable gate | All required checks hold continuously for five seconds |
| Play | Real browser Play at 1×; monotonic clock, golden positions/presence, actual SVG nodes/parents |
| During motion | Record transient divergence; flag sustained view mismatch over five seconds only with adequate samples |
| Checkpoints | Allow 60 s per explicit pause, then resume on pass or timeout so later segments still run |
| End | Allow 120 s after completion for the same stable gate |
| Integrity | Native/container/medium identities unchanged; no hidden RF assistance, faults, SSE gaps or browser errors |
| Cleanup | Default twenty-client world, paused, no lease/fault; original service/action cap restored |

A continuously moving target need not be strictly converged every instant.
Record one-second target sampling cadence and actual gaps; screenshots can
slow sampling. Do not infer continuous failure across unobserved intervals.

For presence worlds, inspect exact MAC sets in both views and kernel links at
settled boundaries. During fronthaul loss require no clients on the disabled
role after five seconds while backhaul remains connected. Check directional
RF gains against the asymmetric golden via the read-only midpoint audit;
reject samples crossing epochs. Protected startup backhaul need only match
the connected actual tree, not form geometric branches.

## Execute

From this repository on an observer able to SSH to the physical host:

```sh
node tests/test-room-feature-acceptance.js
node --check tests/room-feature-acceptance.js
export PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/absolute/path/to/node_modules/playwright-core
export CHROMIUM_PATH=/absolute/path/to/chromium/chrome
node tests/room-feature-acceptance.js --yes-act --flavor prpl \
  --host rev150 --vm prplmesh-20-0908 \
  --room-url http://192.168.2.150:18891/ \
  --topology-url http://192.168.2.150:8091/ \
  --worlds /absolute/path/to/deployed-goldens \
  --output /absolute/path/to/new-results --native-audits 1
node tests/room-feature-report.js /absolute/path/to/new-results \
  /absolute/path/to/deployed-goldens > audited-summary.json
```

Replace deployment arguments as needed. Add `--observer-cpus CPU_LIST` when
sharing a lab host. Repeat `--world WORLD_ID` only for explicitly targeted
runs; omit it to enumerate the live catalog. Use independent output directories,
browsers and host samplers for simultaneous backends. Inspect the harness's
nonzero exit and report; completing playback alone is not acceptance.

## Evidence and restoration

Retain per-room JSON, sampled JSONL, SSE, world hashes, screenshots and a compact
matrix: loaded/final/checkpoint convergence, presence/RF/visual correctness,
verified/failed/unmatched actions, p50/p95/max timing and native identities.
Distinguish collection, submission, verification and rendering intervals.
Absent timestamps are unavailable, not zero; timeouts are censored failures,
not omitted successful samples.

Always remove the named temporary service override, daemon-reload, restore the
original room and verify the default roster, paused time zero, no held lease,
no fault and the original action cap. Stop only owned browsers/host samplers.
For a separate opt-in crash-recovery test, use
`tests/room-recovery-smoke.py --help`; it deliberately kills only the room
process and must be scheduled, not silently included in a normal room pass.
